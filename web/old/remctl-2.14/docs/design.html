<H1>Old Remctl Design Document</H1>

<P>This is the original design document for version 1.0 of remctl.  It
is now fairly thoroughly obsolete and is included only for historical
information and reference.</P>

<H2>Design Document for Remctl</H2>

<P>Anton Ushakov, November 2002.</P>

<P>Conceptually remctl is an RPC service for remote execution of
commands. However unlike many system-utility RPC services, is employs
Kerberos authentication, fine-grained authorization, and command requests
are mapped to predefined system executables that perform concrete services
- the requested command is never executed directly by a shell. The a
"type", and a "service" within that type are specified as part of the
request and are mapped to an executable program on the server. Additional
arguments are passed to that predefined command as parameters. Only one
command is allowed per a transaction, with one response. </P>

<P>Remctld is a deamon implemented in C and compilable on Linux, AIX and
Solaris. The client-side program, remctl, is implemented in C and Java -
for system independence. Authentication uses Kerberos V through the use of
GSS-API, which is a language independent standard that's more general,
easier to code and debug then direct Kerberos V API. Client's identity is
taken from the Kerberos V ticket cache that should be availble in the
client's environment. Server's identity is taken from the host principal
of the machine that remctld is run on, using the default keytab file,
unless an environemnt variable is set to point to a different one. The
identity of the server can be changed to a principal other that the host
principal using command like options, and the client also has command like
options to specify a different server principal.</P>

<P>The Client and Server sections below detail the communication
protocol and packet formats. All communication packets are encrypted
using </P>

<H2>Client</H2>

<H3>Authentication</H3>

  <P>Client connects and authenticates using tokens from gssapi
  calls. Format of all tokens is the same, including request and response
  tokens.</P>

<pre>
    flags                 1 byte
    length of data        4 bytes
    data payload          &lt;length of data&gt;
</pre>

  <P>The authentication communication sequence is initiated by an empty
  token sent by the Client. Thereafter the tokens are passed to and
  received from gssapi calls and are sent over the network in the format
  specified above. The authentication sequence continues until gssapi sets
  a status variable signifying "authentication context established".

  <P>Flags in the above token format are for signifying the stage in
  communication, such as "establishing authentication context", "end of
  tokens", "request token", "response token", or "error token".

<H3>Request</H3>

  <P>Client accepts these command line arguments: <BR>
  <EM>type service arg1 .. argN</EM><BR>
  Client gets the arguments in the standard argv format: array of strings.

  <P>Client passes these arguments packed into a data payload section of a
  token. Payload format is the argc following by pairs of a lendth of an
  argument and the argument itself:</P>

<pre>
    number of arguments    4 bytes
    length of argument     4 bytes                | This is part is repeated 
    argument               &lt;length of argument&gt;   | &lt;number of arguments&gt; times 
</pre>

  <P>After the payload request token is sent, a MIC checksum token is
  expected from the server. The payload data is of type "MIC" and is
  passed directly to the gssapi for verification. It is a checksum
  computed on the server after decrypting the request payload token. It is
  not a proof of message authenticity or integrity, as that is inherent in
  the Kerberos V mechanism, it is a confirmation of wire encryption used
  for the transmission. Technically it is not necessary, but is used for
  extra confirmation here.

<H3>Response</H3>

  <P>Client waits for a response which is expected in the same token
  format. The flags for a response can be "response" and "error".

  <P>The payload format in the response message is:</P>

<pre>
    return code                 4 bytes
    length of return message    4 bytes
    return message              &lt;length of return message&gt;
</pre>

  <P>After decrypting the response token, the MIC checksum token is sent
  back to the Server, ending the transaction. </P>

<H2>Server</H2>

  <P>The server is written to work with <EM>tcpserver</EM> or
  <EM>inetd</EM>, which provide simultanous connection handling.  As a
  side-effect the conf file gets re-read on every request since a new
  process of remctld is spawned on every connection.

<H3>Authentication</H3>
  
  <P>The gssapi context establishment takes place the same way as
  described the Client section above.</P>

<H3>Authorization</H3>
  
  <P>Upon startup Server reads, parses and stores the conf file. Its
  format per line is:

  <P><I>type service command {aclfile}+</I></P>

  <TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=5 background="" border=1 valign="top">
    <TBODY>
    <TR>
      <TD vAlign=top background="">type</TD>
      <TD>
        <P>Specifies the "domain" of commands, like ss (service server -
        the srvtab generation system) or cgi (for approval and creation of
        cgi accounts).</P>
      </TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD vAlign=top background="">service</TD>
      <TD>
        <P>A particular service within the type. If the entire type is
        specified with one line, the keyword ALL can be used instead of a
        service name.</P>
      </TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD vAlign=top background="">command</TD>
      <TD>Path and filename of a program to execute as part of the 
      request.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD vAlign=top background="">aclfile</TD>
      <TD>
        <P>A file containing a list of identities, one per line, of those
        authorized to request this service. One or more aclfiles may be
        provided. The keyword ANYUSER may be used to signify a service
        that is not access restricted.</P>
      </TD>
    </TR>
    </TBODY>
  </TABLE>

  <P>Both the conf file and aclfiles allow empty lines and comments that
  start with a '#' character.

<H3>Request</H3>

  <P>Packet format is described in the Client section. A MIC checksum is
  sent back to the Client after decrypting the request token.

  <P>Once the request's <EM>type</EM> and <EM>service</EM> arguments are
  mapped to an executable, and the authorization of the client is
  established, remctld forks and does an execv call to run the executable
  in question. Pipes are set up to collect STDOUT and STDERR as well as
  the return code. This information is then packed up and sent back to the
  client.

<H3>Response</H3>

  <P>Packet format is described in the Client section. The token flag
  signifies a positive or erroneous response. A MIC checksum is expected
  from the Client after the response token is decrypted by the
  Client. This ends the transaction.</P>

<H2>Shared Code</H2>

  <P>A utility library is used by the C implementations of both Client and
  Server. This provides the common functionality of sending a message with
  payload and receiving one, as well as sending and receiving a raw token
  (used in context establishment).</P>
